# Background/Objective
My project for Mod3 is a draw poker app. Although lacking in full functionality, I have managed to be able to chronicle each step of the way and understand exactly where my issues occur (a real time Byebug, if you will).

# Setup
To clone this GitHub repository (w/ SSH), in your terminal type:
```
git clone git@github.com:sgold57/mod3-project-draw-poker.git
```

# API Used
http://deckofcardsapi.com

# Challenges Faced
I was unable to successfully execute the hit function, as I could not reconcile dismissing the default action of my event listener (reloading the page and starting a new hand w/ a new deck) with getting the query parameters for the cards that I would like to have replaced. I also only got around to the logic of evaluating final hands (which I was looking forward to), so there is definitely still work to be done there.
Ideally, if I were to continue w/ this project, I'd add the option for users to sign up and have the option of choosing how many hands they'd like to play (and thus giing users ability to save their high scores for each denomination of gameplay).
Additionally, I wanted to incorporate the Jeopardy trivia API to act as a buffer between successfully substituting a card (if question answered incorrectly, user does not get new card).
